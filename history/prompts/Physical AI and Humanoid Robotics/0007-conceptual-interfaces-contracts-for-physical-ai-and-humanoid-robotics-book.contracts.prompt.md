## Prompt

```
(Implicit prompt to generate contracts/README.md based on spec.md and plan.md)
```

## Response snapshot

Generated contracts/README.md outlining conceptual interfaces and communication protocols.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clear definition of interaction points and data exchange mechanisms for robotics and AI components.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: specs/Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics/contracts/README.md, history/prompts/Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics/0007-conceptual-interfaces-contracts-for-physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics-book.contracts.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Generate quickstart.md and update agent context.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully conceptualized and documented the interface 'contracts' for the educational book, providing a structured understanding of system interactions.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
