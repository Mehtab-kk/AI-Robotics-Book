## Prompt

```
(Implicit prompt to generate data-model.md based on spec.md)
```

## Response snapshot

Generated data-model.md outlining key conceptual entities and data flows.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A clear conceptual data model is established, aiding in the understanding of data interactions within the book's context.
- 🧪 Tests: n/a
- 📁 Files: specs/Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics/data-model.md, history/prompts/Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics/0006-data-model-for-physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics-book.data-model.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Generate contracts/ and quickstart.md.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully conceptualized and documented the data model for the educational book, aligning with the project's unique requirements.
