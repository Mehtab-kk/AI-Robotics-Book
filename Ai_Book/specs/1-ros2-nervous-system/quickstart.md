# Quickstart: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module teaches the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for humanoid robot control. You'll learn how robots communicate, process information, and execute actions through ROS 2's "nervous system."

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- No prior robotics experience required
- Access to a ROS 2 Humble environment (simulation only)

## Learning Path
1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understand the architecture and purpose
2. **Nodes** - Learn the building blocks of ROS 2 systems
3. **Communication** - Master Topics, Services, and Actions
4. **Python Integration** - Connect AI agents using rclpy
5. **URDF Models** - Describe robot structure and components
6. **Simulation** - Launch and test humanoid models

## Key Concepts
- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform robot functions
- **Topics**: Publish/subscribe communication channels
- **Services**: Request/response communication patterns
- **Actions**: Goal-based communication for long-running tasks
- **URDF**: Unified Robot Description Format for robot structure

## Getting Started
1. Read Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2
2. Follow the conceptual examples (no hardware required)
3. Progress through each chapter sequentially
4. Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter
5. Finish with the Module 1 mini-project: "Humanoid Startup Test"

## Safety Notice
All examples in this module are simulation-only. No hardware connections or physical robots are required.
