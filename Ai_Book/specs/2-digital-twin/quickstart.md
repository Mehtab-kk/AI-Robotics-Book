# Quickstart: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This module teaches digital twin concepts for humanoid robots, focusing on simulation environments using Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn to create virtual replicas of robots that mirror real-world behavior for safe testing and development.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- No prior Gazebo or Unity experience required

## Learning Path
1. **Digital Twin Concepts** - Understand the virtual vs. physical robot relationship
2. **Gazebo Simulation** - Physics, gravity, collisions, and environment building
3. **Unity Rendering** - High-fidelity visualization and interaction
4. **Sensor Simulation** - LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMU simulation
5. **Integration** - Combining Gazebo physics with Unity rendering

## Key Concepts
- **Digital Twin**: Virtual replica of a physical robot system
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic gravity, collisions, and material properties
- **Sensor Simulation**: Virtual sensors producing realistic data
- **Environment Modeling**: Creating 3D worlds for robot testing

## Getting Started
1. Read Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Twins
2. Follow the conceptual examples (no hardware required)
3. Progress through each chapter sequentially
4. Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter
5. Finish with the Module 2 mini-project: Digital Twin Test

## Safety Notice
All examples in this module are simulation-only. No hardware connections or physical robots are required.
