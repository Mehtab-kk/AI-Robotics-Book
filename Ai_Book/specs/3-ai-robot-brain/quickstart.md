# Quickstart: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
This module teaches AI-robot integration using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. You'll learn to connect AI agents to robot control, create photorealistic simulations, implement VSLAM for mapping, and use Nav2 for path planning. The focus is on creating intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive and navigate their environment safely in simulation.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Completion of Module 2 (Digital Twin simulation concepts)
- Basic Python knowledge
- No prior NVIDIA Isaac experience required

## Learning Path
1. **NVIDIA Isaac Introduction** - Understand the Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS ecosystem
2. **Photorealistic Simulation** - Create realistic scenes and generate synthetic data
3. **Isaac ROS Integration** - Connect AI agents to ROS-controlled robots
4. **VSLAM Implementation** - Visual mapping and localization in simulation
5. **Nav2 Path Planning** - Autonomous navigation for humanoid robots
6. **Sensor Integration** - Combine multiple sensors for AI perception
7. **AI Action Planning** - Convert decisions to robot actions
8. **Mini-Project** - Complete AI-robot integration test

## Key Concepts
- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's photorealistic simulation environment
