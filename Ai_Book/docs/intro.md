# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book covers everything you need to know about building intelligent humanoid robots, from the foundational ROS 2 framework to advanced AI control systems.

## Overview

This book is structured into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, the middleware that powers robotic applications
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Create realistic simulations for testing and development
3. **Module 3: AI Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Implement intelligent control systems using NVIDIA Isaac
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Build multimodal AI systems that can perceive, understand, and act

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring the first module on ROS 2 fundamentals, where you'll learn how to build the nervous system of your robotic applications.
